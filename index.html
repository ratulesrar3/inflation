        <div class="title">Price Inflation</div>
        The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often referred to as the source of truth for purchasing power in the United States. But what if there are better measures to reflect the how price changes affect purschaing power?

        <div class="title">Bureau of Labor Statistic (BLS) &amp; CPI</div>
        CPI expresses the current prices of a basket of goods and services relative to the prices of those same goods and services in a previous year to show the effect of inflation on purchasing power. The BLS reports CPI for different goods each fiscal quarter and aggregates them into one index. However, daily calculations may be more accurate.

        <div class="title">MTI's Billion Prices Project (BPP)</div>
        PriceStats, a BPP partner, measures inflation in 22 economies daily using online prices, with the goal of more easily anticipating large shifts in inflation trends. This is arguably a much better indicator of the change in prices of goods than aggregate CPI.

        <div class="title">What's the difference?</div>
        The online PriceStats index is higher except for a short time following 2009, suggesting the CPI might be underestimating inflation and price changes for goods.

        <div class="title">CPI by specific goods and services</div>
        Consumers certainly have to buy food. Food prices seem to tend higher than both aggregate CPI and the PriceStats index.

        <div class="title">What about housing?</div>
        Housing prices have also steadily recovered in the aftermath of the Great Recession.

        <div class="title">What's going on with energy?</div>
        Energy has seen the most price fluctuation of anything we've looked at, by far. Many of the dips in aggregate CPI have been following dips in energy, so this may be disproportionately influencing aggregate CPI.
