    <h1>Price Inflation</h1>
    <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often referred to as the source of truth for purchasing power in the United States.</p>
    <p>CPI expresses the year over year change in price of a basket of goods, and is reported each fiscal quarter by the Bureau of Labor Statisitics (BLS).</p>
    <p>In the chart below, what looks like a trendline for quarterly CPI values is actually a daily index calculation based online prices by MIT's Billion Prices Project (BPP).</p>
    <p>See for yourself by using the brush to zoom in!</p>

    <p>We see a larger difference between daily and quarterly calculations, especially between 2014-2015.</p>
    <p>This may be related to the emergence of Amazon capturing a greater share of online retail, which may have increased prices online.</p>

    <h1>Volatility in CPI</h1> 
    <p>The CPI is an aggregate of prices indexes for specific goods and services, which have their own volatility.</p>
    <p>Take a look at three sectors that comprise the CPI: food, housing, and energy.</p>
